# Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data Project

run_analysis.R is the script that carries out the tasks assigned in the course project. 
In summary being:
1. Merging the training and test data.
2. Extracting from all the data, the mean and standard deviation measurements. 
3. Assigning the names from the activity_labels.txt file to the numbers their respective columns.
4. Renaming the column names from the datasets to less abbreviated terms.
5. Creating the new independent dataset with the average for the different activities and subjects.

CodeBook.md contains an explanation more in depth of the changes performed on the different file, 
in unison to how the run_analysis.R runs. 

IndependentData.txt is the final file required showing the work performed in the run_analysis.R script.
